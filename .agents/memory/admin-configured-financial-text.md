Customer-facing text for deposit minimums, withdrawal minimums, fees, and schedules must use the saved platform settings. Re-fetch these settings when the relevant screen opens or regains focus; do not impose a UI-only minimum floor that differs from the configured value.

**Why:** The administrator changed these values, but cached settings and a hardcoded deposit floor left the customer-facing text unchanged.

**How to apply:** Use the shared minimum-setting defaults only when a setting is missing or invalid, validate deposits against the configured minimum on both client and server, and keep fixed quick-amount choices separate from that minimum.
